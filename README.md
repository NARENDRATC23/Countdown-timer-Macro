# Countdown-timer-Macro
countdown timer will normally show how much time is left in which to achieve a particular task.
A progress bar will normally show how much has been so far processed for a particular synchronous task, such as process that copies data from one area to another. Conversely, a countdown timer will normally show how much time is left in which to achieve a particular task. The key difference is that there is normally a lot going on when a progress bar is in play, so it's rather easy to synchrounously take time out from a loop, calculate how much has been achieved and provide a regular visual update. When a countdown timer is in play, there is usually nothing going on.We would typically be waiting for user input or some other asynchronous event. This means that we cannot use the approach of reporting progress as part of a loop, since there is no loop. This project will show how to create a class that can be used both to show countdown and progress.
